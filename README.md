# About

* Giftastic is a page that allows you to add a button with text on it onto the documents body, and whenever the button is clicked, giphy images of whatever button is pressed will appear. 
example: 

* This project is useful for beginner web devolopers to practice their skills in using API's and pulling information from these extensive databases and be placed on their projects. It gives great use and increases understanding of how to use JSON, javascript, and jquery to pull data, store it in HTML elements, and present them on a fully functional page.

* To get started with this page, users can click in the search form titled "Add a Gif!". User can place whatever simple text they want to in the search bar, and click "Add". This will populate a button that will be appended to the top of the page. Then the user can click the newly populated button to generate a giphy images related to that buttons name.

* I am the sole contributor to this project and I maintain it.
